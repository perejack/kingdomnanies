# Google Ads Disapproval Fix Summary

This document outlines the steps taken to resolve the Google Ads disapproval for the "Compromised site" and "Circumventing systems" issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **"Compromised Site" & "Circumventing Systems"**

*   **Problem Analysis**: Google's crawlers detected that the website was hotlinking images from external domains (`unsplash.com`, `namati.org`, etc.). This can trigger the "Compromised site" warning if any of those external domains have been flagged by Google. It can also be interpreted as a "Circumventing systems" violation if the content is perceived as being pulled from untrusted sources.

*   **Solution Implemented**:
    1.  **Downloaded External Images**: All externally hosted images were downloaded into the project's `public/assets/` directory.
    2.  **Created a Download Script**: A PowerShell script (`download-imgs.ps1`) was created to automate this process for future use.
    3.  **Updated Image Paths**: The `src/pages/Index.tsx` component was updated to reference the locally hosted images instead of the external URLs.
    4.  **Handled Failed Download**: For an image that failed to download, a suitable replacement was used from the existing local assets.

## Summary of Changes

*   **Localized all images**: Your site no longer depends on external domains for its image content.
*   **Reduced Security Risk**: By hosting your own images, you have eliminated the risk of your site being flagged due to issues on third-party domains.
*   **Improved Ad Policy Compliance**: The changes make your site more compliant with Google's advertising policies.

## Next Steps

1.  **Deploy the Changes**: Deploy the updated version of your site to Netlify.
    ```bash
    # Build the site for production
    npm run build

    # Deploy to Netlify
    netlify deploy --prod
    ```
    Alternatively, push your changes to your connected Git repository.

2.  **Verify the Fix**: After deployment, open your live website and ensure all images are loading correctly.

3.  **Appeal the Google Ads Decision**:
    *   Go to your Google Ads dashboard.
    *   Select the disapproved ad and choose to **Appeal**.
    *   In the appeal form, explain the actions you've taken. You can use the following statement:

        > "I have resolved the 'Compromised site' and 'Circumventing systems' issues. The website was previously loading images from external domains, which may have triggered the warning. I have now downloaded all images and am hosting them locally on my own server. The site no longer has third-party image dependencies."

This should resolve the disapproval. If you face any further issues, you may need to contact Google Ads support directly.
